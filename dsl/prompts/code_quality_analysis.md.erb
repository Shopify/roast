Now perform a detailed code quality analysis. Focus on:

1. **Code Patterns**: Look for common patterns, both good and problematic
2. **Security Concerns**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities
3. **Performance Issues**: Check for obvious performance bottlenecks
4. **Test Coverage**: Assess testing strategies and coverage
5. **Documentation**: Evaluate code documentation and readability

Use available tools to examine specific files and provide concrete examples of issues found.
