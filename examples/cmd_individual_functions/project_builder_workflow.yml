    # Project Builder Tutorial

    Welcome! This workflow teaches you how to create project structures using
    command functions combined with file writing capabilities.

    You have access to:
    - `pwd()` - Check current location
    - `ls(args: "...")` - List files
    - `mkdir(args: "...")` - Create directories
    - `echo(args: "...")` - Display messages
    - `cat(args: "...")` - View file contents
    - `write_file()` - Create new files

    I'll demonstrate how to:
    1. Create a well-organized directory structure
    2. Add essential files like README and configuration
    3. Verify the structure was created correctly

    This is a practical skill for automating project setup!
