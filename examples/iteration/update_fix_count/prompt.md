I'll update the count of fixes that have been successfully applied.

Current fix count: 
```
{{output.update_fix_count || 0}}
```

Verification result from the previous step:
```json
{{output.verify_fix}}
```

I'll increment the fix count if the verification was successful or partial, but not if it failed.

```javascript
let currentCount = parseInt({{output.update_fix_count || 0}});
let verificationStatus = "{{output.verify_fix.status}}";

if (verificationStatus === "success" || verificationStatus === "partial") {
  currentCount += 1;
}

return { fixes_applied: currentCount };
```

This updated count will be used to determine whether we've met our target for the number of fixes to implement.
