I'll verify that the fix implemented in the previous step correctly addresses the identified issue.

Here are the details of the issue that was fixed:
```json
<%= output.select_next_issue %>
```

And here is the implementation of the fix:
```json
<%= output.implement_fix %>
```

Now I'll read the updated file to verify the changes:
```ruby
<%= read_file(output.select_next_issue.file_path) %>
```

I'll evaluate the fix based on these criteria:
1. Does it fully address the identified issue?
2. Did it introduce any new issues or regressions?
3. Does it maintain the original functionality?
4. Does it follow Ruby best practices and style conventions?
5. Is it minimal and focused (changing only what was necessary)?

Based on this evaluation, I'll provide:
1. A verification status (success, partial, failure)
2. Detailed reasoning for the status
3. Any recommendations for further improvements or adjustments
4. An overall assessment of the code quality improvement
