# Write Summary

Create a summary of your findings from the directory exploration and file analysis.

Available tools for this step:
- write_file: Write content to a file
- echo: Display text (useful for showing what you're about to write)

Please:
1. Use echo to preview the summary content
2. Write a summary to a file called "project_analysis.md" that includes:
   - Directory structure overview
   - Key files identified
   - Code patterns found
   - Any interesting observations

Note: You cannot use grep, read_file, pwd, or ls in this step - only write_file and echo are available.
