# Code Quality Improvement Report

## Summary of Analysis and Improvements

I've analyzed {{output.get_files_to_analyze.split('\n').length}} Ruby files for code quality issues and made targeted improvements.

### Files Analyzed

```
{{output.get_files_to_analyze}}
```

### Issues Identified

Total issues identified: {{output.prioritize_issues.total_issues}}

Issues by severity:
- High: {{output.prioritize_issues.high_severity || 0}}
- Medium: {{output.prioritize_issues.medium_severity || 0}}
- Low: {{output.prioritize_issues.low_severity || 0}}

Issues by type:
- Complexity: {{output.prioritize_issues.complexity_issues || 0}}
- Maintainability: {{output.prioritize_issues.maintainability_issues || 0}}
- Performance: {{output.prioritize_issues.performance_issues || 0}}
- Style: {{output.prioritize_issues.style_issues || 0}}

### Improvements Made

Number of fixes applied: {{output.update_fix_count.fixes_applied || 0}}

{{#if output.update_fix_count.fixes_applied > 0}}
Fixes by type:
{{#each output.fix_summary}}
- {{this.type}}: {{this.count}} ({{this.percentage}}% of total)
{{/each}}

Top files improved:
{{#each output.file_improvements}}
- {{this.file}}: {{this.issues_fixed}} issues fixed
{{/each}}
{{else}}
No fixes were applied during this run.
{{/if}}

## Detailed Fix List

{{#if output.update_fix_count.fixes_applied > 0}}
{{#each output.fixes_applied}}
### Fix #{{@index + 1}}: {{this.issue.type}} in {{this.issue.file_path}}

**Issue**: {{this.issue.description}}  
**Location**: {{this.issue.location}}  
**Severity**: {{this.issue.severity}}  

**Solution Applied**: {{this.fix_description}}

```diff
{{this.diff}}
```

**Verification**: {{#if this.verification.success}}✅ Successful{{else}}❌ Failed: {{this.verification.reason}}{{/if}}

{{/each}}
{{else}}
No fixes were applied during this run.
{{/if}}

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

Based on the remaining issues, here are the top recommendations for improving code quality:

{{#each output.top_recommendations}}
{{@index + 1}}. **{{this.title}}**  
   {{this.description}}  
   Affected files: {{this.affected_files}}
{{/each}}

## Conclusion

This automated code quality improvement run has {{#if output.update_fix_count.fixes_applied > 0}}successfully addressed {{output.update_fix_count.fixes_applied}} issues{{else}}identified issues but did not apply any fixes{{/if}}. The remaining issues should be reviewed and addressed as part of ongoing code maintenance.

I'll generate a comprehensive summary report of all the code quality improvements made during this workflow.

Total number of fixes applied:
```
{{output.update_fix_count.fixes_applied || 0}}
```

I'll analyze the following data to create the report:
1. Original list of issues identified:
```json
{{output.prioritize_issues}}
```

2. Issues that were addressed:
```json
{{outputs_of.select_next_issue}}
```

3. Implementation and verification details:
```json
{{outputs_of.implement_fix}}
{{outputs_of.verify_fix}}
```

The report will include:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Total files analyzed
   - Total issues identified
   - Issues fixed vs. remaining
   - Most common issue types
   
2. **Detailed Analysis by File**
   - Issues fixed per file
   - Before/after code quality assessment
   
3. **Implementation Details**
   - Description of each fix
   - Impact on code quality
   - Verification results
   
4. **Recommendations**
   - Remaining high-priority issues
   - Suggested next steps
   - Long-term code quality improvement suggestions

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the code quality improvements made and serves as documentation for the changes implemented.
