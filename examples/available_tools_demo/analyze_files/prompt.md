# Analyze Files

Based on the directory exploration, analyze the code files in this project.

Available tools for this step:
- grep: Search for patterns in files
- read_file: Read the contents of a file

Please:
1. Search for Ruby files (*.rb) or other relevant code files
2. Look for key patterns like class definitions, method definitions, or important comments
3. Read a sample file to understand the code structure
4. Provide insights about the codebase

Note: You cannot use pwd, ls, or write_file in this step - only grep and read_file are available.
