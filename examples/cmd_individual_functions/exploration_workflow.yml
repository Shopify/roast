    # Project Exploration Guide

    Let's explore your project structure using command functions! This workflow
    teaches you how to navigate and understand your codebase.

    You've configured four useful commands for exploration:
    - `pwd()` - Check your current location
    - `ls(args: "...")` - List files and directories
    - `cat(args: "...")` - View file contents
    - `git(args: "...")` - Check version control status

    I'll show you how to use these commands to:
    1. Understand where you are in the project
    2. Explore the directory structure
    3. Examine specific files
    4. Check your git repository status
