Finally, based on the conversation transcript above, go ahead and provide specific, actionable recommendations that would most effectively improve the overall test score.

Focus on recommendations that would:

1. Increase coverage
2. Add more assertions where needed
3. Make the tests more maintainable or readable
4. Ensure tests serve as specifications by having clear, descriptive names
5. Reduce excessive mocking/stubbing that couples tests to implementation details
6. Improve test structure to reduce setup complexity
7. Ensure tests focus on behavior rather than implementation details
8. Ensure gaps in private methods are tested through public methods
9. Fix any issues with test helpers that are used incorrectly or unnecessarily
10. Improve efficiency by combining or deleting tests where appropriate (note that having more than one assertion per test is acceptable)
11. Fix any violations of the objective criteria (idempotency, determinism, etc.)
12. Be specific about edge cases that should be covered by tests. Write down in the recommendations which edge cases you are referring to.
13. Do not recommend the use of RSpec features like `let` for Minispec tests.

IF YOU IDENTIFY EDGE CASES, YOU MUST BE SPECIFIC ABOUT THEM IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS.

RESPONSE FORMAT: You must respond in JSON format inside <json> XML tags without additional commentary.
