   - Types of refactorings applied
   - Overall impact on code quality

2. **Key Improvements**
   - Most significant refactorings and their benefits
   - Complexity reductions achieved
   - Readability enhancements

3. **Recommendations for Future**
   - Any remaining code smells that require larger architectural changes
