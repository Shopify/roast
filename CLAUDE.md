# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## About the codebase
- This is a Ruby gem called Roast. Its purpose is to run AI workflows defined in a YAML file.
- Note that this project now uses Zeitwerk, which means you don't have to manually require project files anymore

## Commands
- Default THE SUITE RUNS FAST SO USE THIS  IN MOST CASES (tests + lint w/autocorrect): `bundle exec rake`
- Run single test: `bundle exec ruby -Itest test/path/to/test_file.rb`
- Lint: `bundle exec rubocop`
- Lint (with autocorrect, preferred): `bundle exec rubocop -A`
- Whenever you want to run the whole test suite just run `bundle exec rake` to also run linting, and note the linting errors too (most will auto correct but not all)
- **Run roast locally**: Use `bin/roast` (not `bundle exec roast` which may use the installed gem)

## Tech stack
- `thor` and `cli-ui` for the CLI tool
- Testing: Use Minitest, VCR for HTTP mocking, test files named with `_test.rb` suffix
- Prefer using the more literate `test "this is a test description" do` type of testing that we get from extending ActiveSupport::TestCase over the primitive XUnit-style def test_description headings for tests

## Code Style Guidelines
- Naming: snake_case for variables/methods, CamelCase for classes/modules, ALL_CAPS for constants
- Module structure: Use nested modules under the `Roast` namespace
- Command pattern: Commands implement a `call` method and class-level `help` method
- Error handling: Use custom exception classes and structured error handling
- Errors that should stop the program execution should `raise(CLI::Kit::Abort, "Error message")`
- Documentation: Include method/class documentation with examples when appropriate
- Dependencies: Prefer existing gems in the Gemfile before adding new ones
- Define class methods inside `class << self; end` declarations.
- Add runtime dependencies to `roast.gemspec`.
- Add development dependencies to `Gemfile`.
- Don't ever test private methods directly. Specs should test behavior, not implementation.
- I do not like test-specific code embedded in production code, don't ever do that
- **Do not use require_relative**
- Require statements should always be in alphabetical order
- Always leave a blank line after module includes and before the rest of the class

## Architecture Guidelines
- **SOLID principles are important** - don't violate them
- **Maintain proper separation of concerns**: Don't mix unrelated concepts in the same class or module
  - Example: Conditional execution (if/unless) should NOT be mixed with iteration execution (each/repeat)
  - Each concept should have its own executor class and be handled separately
- **Use appropriate inheritance**: Only inherit from a base class if the child truly "is-a" type of the parent
  - Don't inherit just to reuse some methods - use composition instead
- **Follow Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class should have one reason to change
  - IterationExecutor handles iterations (each, repeat)
  - ConditionalExecutor handles conditionals (if, unless)
  - Don't combine different responsibilities in one class
- **Do not implement prompts "inline" using a prompt: attribute nested under step names, that violates the primary design architecture of Roast**
- When faced with the choice between working around an architectural issue or code smell versus actually diving into fixing the design issue or code smell, choose the latter more principled approach
- When fixing code smells, you don't have to worry about internal backwards compatibility 

## Workflow Configuration Syntax
- The `steps` key in the workflow configuration is an array of step names
- Only step names, inline prompts, and control flow keywords are allowed in the steps array
- Additional per-step configuration is provided in a top-level hash with the step name as the key, not within steps!!! (Very important)
- The reason that steps are not configured "inline" within the steps array is so that the shape of the workflow is as obvious as possible
- Step labels are inferred for most steps and optional for inline prompts, but required for steps that need custom configuration
- The result of running a step is stored in the `workflow.output` hash with the step label as the key

## How Roast Tools Work (CRITICAL - READ THIS!)
**Tools in Roast are NOT explicitly invoked in workflow steps!** This is a fundamental concept that differs from many other workflow systems.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Tools are capabilities available to the LLM** - They are functions the LLM can choose to call while executing a step
2. **Steps contain prompts** - Steps describe what needs to be done, not how to do it
3. **The LLM decides when to use tools** - While executing a step's prompt, the LLM analyzes the task and calls tools as needed
4. **Tools are registered, not declared in steps** - Use the `tools:` section to make tools available, but never use a `tool:` key in step configuration

### Correct inline prompt syntax:
```yaml
steps:
  - analyze_code: |
      Analyze the codebase and identify performance bottlenecks.
      Use any available tools to read files and search for patterns.
```

### INCORRECT syntax (DO NOT USE):
```yaml
# WRONG - no 'prompt:' key
steps:
  - analyze_code:
      prompt: "Analyze the codebase"
      
# WRONG - no 'tool:' key
steps:
  - run_analysis:
      tool: coding_agent
      prompt: "Analyze code"
```

### How tools are actually used:
When the LLM executes the `analyze_code` step above, it might:
1. Decide it needs to read files and call `read_file(path)`
2. Decide it needs to search and call `grep(pattern, path)`
3. Decide it needs Claude Swarm and call `swarm(prompt, config_path)`

The LLM makes these decisions based on the prompt and available tools, similar to how Claude (you) decides when to use Bash, Read, or other tools when responding to user requests.

## Step Configuration
- The `path` key in a step configuration is the path to a Ruby file that defines a custom step.
- The `model` key in a step configuration is the model to use for the step.
- The `print_response` key in a step configuration is a boolean that determines whether the step's response should be printed to the console.

## Coding Guidance and Expectations
- Do not decide unilaterally to leave code for the sake of "backwards compatibility"... always run those decisions by me first.
- Don't ever commit and push changes unless directly told to do so
- You can't test input steps yourself since they block, so ask me to do it manually

## Git Workflow Practices
1. **Amending Commits**:
   - Use `git commit --amend --no-edit` to add staged changes to the last commit without changing the commit message
   - This is useful for incorporating small fixes or changes that belong with the previous commit
   - Be careful when amending commits that have already been pushed, as it will require a force push

2. **Force Pushing Safety**:
   - Always use `git push --force-with-lease` rather than `git push --force` when pushing amended commits
   - This prevents accidentally overwriting remote changes made by others that you haven't pulled yet
   - It's a safer alternative that respects collaborative work environments

4. **PR Management**:
   - Pay attention to linting results before pushing to avoid CI failures

## GitHub API Commands
To get comments from a Pull Request using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Get review comments from a PR
gh api repos/Shopify/roast/pulls/{pr_number}/comments

# Get issue-style comments
gh api repos/Shopify/roast/issues/{pr_number}/comments

# Filter comments from a specific user using jq
gh api repos/Shopify/roast/pulls/{pr_number}/comments | jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "username")'

# Get only the comment content
gh api repos/Shopify/roast/pulls/{pr_number}/comments | jq '.[].body'
```

### Creating and Managing Issues via API

```bash
# Create a new issue
gh api repos/Shopify/roast/issues -X POST -F title="Issue Title" -F body="Issue description"

# Update an existing issue
gh api repos/Shopify/roast/issues/{issue_number} -X PATCH -F body="Updated description"

# Add a comment to an issue
gh api repos/Shopify/roast/issues/{issue_number}/comments -X POST -F body="Comment text"
```

### Creating and Managing Pull Requests

```bash
# Create a new PR with a detailed description using heredoc
gh pr create --title "PR Title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

Detailed description here...

## Testing

Testing instructions here...
EOF
)"

# Update an existing PR description
gh pr edit {pr_number} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Updated PR description...
EOF
)"

# Check PR details
gh pr view {pr_number}

# View PR diff
gh pr diff {pr_number}
```

### Issue Labeling and Project Management

When creating GitHub issues, always check available labels, projects, and milestones first:

```bash
# List all available labels
gh api repos/Shopify/roast/labels | jq '.[].name'

# List all milestones
gh api repos/Shopify/roast/milestones | jq '.[] | {title: .title, number: .number, state: .state}'

# List projects linked to the roast repository
gh api graphql -f query='
{
  repository(owner: "Shopify", name: "roast") {
    projectsV2(first: 10) {
      nodes {
        title
        number
        url
      }
    }
  }
}' --jq '.data.repository.projectsV2.nodes[] | {title: .title, number: .number, url: .url}'
```

**Issue Creation Workflow**:
1. First check what labels exist and apply appropriate ones when creating the issue
2. After creating the issue, ask the user if they want it added to an existing milestone
3. Ask the user if they want it added to a particular project board

```bash
# Create issue with labels
gh api repos/Shopify/roast/issues -X POST -F title="Issue Title" -F body="Issue description" -F 'labels=["bug", "enhancement"]'

# Add issue to a milestone (after creation)
gh api repos/Shopify/roast/issues/{issue_number} -X PATCH -F milestone={milestone_number}

# Add issue to a GitHub Project
gh project item-add {project_number} --url https://github.com/Shopify/roast/issues/{issue_number}
```

#### Formatting Tips for GitHub API
1. Use literal newlines in the body text instead of `\n` escape sequences
2. When formatting is stripped (like backticks), use alternatives:
   - **Bold text** instead of `code formatting`
   - Add a follow-up comment with proper formatting
3. For complex issues, create the basic issue first, then enhance with formatted comments
4. Always verify the formatting in the created content
5. Use raw JSON for complex formatting requirements:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/Shopify/roast/issues -X POST --raw-field '{"title":"Issue Title","body":"Complex **formatting** with `code` and lists:\n\n1. Item one\n2. Item two"}'
   ```

## PR Review Best Practices
1. **Always provide your honest opinion about the PR** - be candid about both strengths and concerns
2. Give a clear assessment of risks, architectural implications, and potential future issues
3. Don't be afraid to point out potential problems even in otherwise good PRs
4. When reviewing feature flag removal PRs, carefully inspect control flow changes, not just code branch removals
5. Pay special attention to control flow modifiers like `next`, `return`, and `break` which affect iteration behavior
6. Look for variable scope issues, especially for variables that persist across loop iterations
7. Analyze how code behavior changes in all cases, not just how code structure changes
8. Be skeptical of seemingly simple changes that simply remove conditional branches
9. When CI checks fail, look for subtle logic inversions or control flow changes
10. Examine every file changed in a PR with local code for context, focusing on both what's removed and what remains
11. Verify variable initialization, modification, and usage patterns remain consistent after refactoring
12. **Never try to directly check out PR branches** - instead, compare PR changes against the existing local codebase
13. Understand the broader system architecture to identify potential impacts beyond the changed files
14. Look at both the "before" and "after" state of the code when evaluating changes, not just the diff itself
15. Consider how the changes will interact with other components that depend on the modified code
16. Run searches or examine related files even if they're not directly modified by the PR
17. Look for optimization opportunities, especially in frequently-called methods:
    - Unnecessary object creation in loops 
    - Redundant collection transformations
    - Inefficient filtering methods that create temporary collections
18. Prioritize code readability while encouraging performance optimizations:
    - Avoid premature optimization outside of hot paths
    - Consider the tradeoff between readability and performance
    - Suggest optimizations that improve both clarity and performance

## CLI::UI Formatting Tips
- To apply color to terminal output using CLI::UI, use the following syntax:
  ```ruby
  puts ::CLI::UI.fmt("{{red:This field is required. Please provide a value.}}")
  ```
