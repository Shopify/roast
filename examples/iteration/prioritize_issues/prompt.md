I'll analyze all the recommendations I've generated across multiple files and prioritize them according to:

1. Severity of the issues
2. Complexity of implementation
3. Impact on code quality and maintainability
4. Dependencies between issues

Let me review all the recommendations collected so far:

```json
{{outputs_of.generate_recommendations}}
```

I'll create a comprehensive prioritized list of all issues across files, combining similar issues where appropriate. The prioritized list will include:

1. Issue ID
2. File path
3. Issue description 
4. Severity (High, Medium, Low)
5. Implementation difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
6. Priority score (calculated from severity and difficulty)
7. Dependencies (if any)

This prioritized list will guide our approach to addressing the most important issues first, while being mindful of dependencies between issues.
