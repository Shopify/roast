Analyze the provided Ruby code and identify potential code smells or areas for improvement. Consider:

1. Method complexity and length
2. Duplicated code patterns
3. Poor naming conventions
4. Tight coupling between classes
5. Missing abstractions or violated SOLID principles
6. Performance anti-patterns

For each issue found, explain:
- What the problem is
- Why it's problematic
- A general approach to fix it

Focus on the most impactful improvements that would enhance code maintainability and readability.
