# JavaScript File Report Generation

I'm generating a report for a JavaScript file:

- File name: `<%= workflow.output['file_basename'] %>`
- Lines: `<%= workflow.output['patterns_found']['lines'] %>`

## JavaScript-Specific Report

JavaScript files typically contain functions, classes, and import/export statements. I'll generate a report focused on JavaScript code analysis.

### Recommendations for JavaScript Code

1. Follow a consistent style guide (ESLint)
2. Use modern JavaScript features (ES6+)
3. Prefer const and let over var
4. Use async/await for asynchronous code
5. Write unit tests with Jest or Mocha

### Summary

This JavaScript file has been analyzed and basic metrics have been collected. A more detailed analysis would involve parsing the JavaScript code to extract functions, classes, and import/export statements.

I'll create a report file with this information.

I'll use my WriteFile tool to generate the report.

Can you please write the report to `report_<%= workflow.output['file_basename'] %>.md` in the current directory?
