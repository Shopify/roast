name: CodingAgent with Retries Configuration
description: |
  Example workflow demonstrating how to configure the CodingAgent tool
  with automatic retries on failure. The retries option will automatically
  retry the coding agent if it encounters an error during execution.
  Note: this is not the same as running the step

tools:
  - Roast::Tools::CodingAgent:
      retries: 2  # Automatically retry up to 2 times on failure

steps:
  # This step invokes the coding agent directly using the specified number of retries
  - ^implement_a_feature: |
      Create a Ruby script that demonstrates robust error handling.
      The script should:
      1. Attempt to read a file that might not exist
      2. Handle any errors gracefully
      3. Log the results


  # This step invokes the general workflow LLM which can in turn invoke the coding agent.
  # When the general LLM invokes the coding agent, it will execute with the specified number of retries.
  - add_tests: |
      Add test for the feature you just implemented.
      Run the tests and iterate until they all pass.
      Use the CodingAgent tool to write the tests.

add_tests:
  retries: 4
