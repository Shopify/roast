In this first step, try to understand the purpose and dependencies of the spec we will be migrating.

1. Read the provided RSpec file carefully to understand:
   - The purpose of the test suite
   - The subject under test (SUT)
   - Test structure and organization 
   - Dependencies and fixtures used
   - Mocks, stubs, and doubles

2. Search for the SUT implementation and review dependent files to understand context.

3. Identify RSpec-specific features being used, such as:
   - describe/context blocks
   - before/after hooks
   - let and let! declarations
   - expect(...).to syntax and matchers
   - shared examples/contexts
   - metadata and tags

4. Provide a summary of your analysis, including:
   - Purpose of the test suite
   - Main subject under test
   - Key dependencies
   - Testing patterns used
   - Challenging aspects for Minitest conversion

This analysis will guide the next steps of creating an equivalent Minitest implementation.
