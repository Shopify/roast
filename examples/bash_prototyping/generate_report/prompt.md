# Generate System Analysis Report

Based on all the information gathered in previous steps:

1. Create a comprehensive markdown report summarizing:
   - System specifications and OS details
   - Resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Active processes and services
   - Network configuration
   - Any potential issues or interesting findings

2. Save the report to `system_analysis_report.md` using the write_file tool

3. Include timestamps and organize the information in a clear, readable format

The report should be suitable for sharing with other developers or for documentation purposes.
