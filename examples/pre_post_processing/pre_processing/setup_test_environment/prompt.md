# Setup Test Environment

Prepare the test environment for optimization. Please:

1. Ensure all test dependencies are installed
2. Create a backup branch for safety: `test-optimization-backup-<%= timestamp %>`
3. Set up any necessary test databases or fixtures
4. Configure test parallelization settings if available
5. Clear any test caches that might affect benchmarking
