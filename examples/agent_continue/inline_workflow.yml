description: Example workflow using inline agent prompts with continuation

# This example demonstrates using inline agent prompts (direct text after ^)
# combined with the new parameters

steps:
  # Start with a fresh context
  - ^Create a simple Ruby class for managing a todo list with add, remove, and list methods
  
  # Continue from previous session to add more features
  - ^continue_adding_features
  
  # Use context summary to understand what was built
  - ^document_with_context

continue_adding_features:
  continue: true  # This continues from the previous agent session

document_with_context:
  include_context_summary: true  # This will include context about previous steps
