# Creating and Verifying Files

You need to demonstrate file creation and verification capabilities. Create a test directory and file, then verify the operations were successful.

**EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS IN ORDER:**
1. Create directory: `mkdir -p test_cmd_demo`
2. Create file: `echo "This file was created by command functions!" > test_cmd_demo/demo.txt`
3. Verify directory: `ls -la test_cmd_demo/`
4. Verify content: `cat test_cmd_demo/demo.txt`
5. Show completion: `echo "Demo complete! You can remove test_cmd_demo when ready."`

**EFFICIENCY RULE:** Execute each command exactly once in the order shown above.

This exercise demonstrates how command functions can be combined for practical file operations while maintaining security through the workflow's command restrictions.
