Based on the analysis of the skateboard orders, here are the key insights:

*   **Customer Demographics:** The majority of customers are from the USA, with Florida being the state with the highest number of orders, followed by California. This suggests a strong customer base in these regions.
*   **Product Popularity:** "Complete Skateboard" is by far the most popular product, with 25 orders. Other products like wheels, bearings, grip tape, and tools have significantly fewer individual orders. This indicates that customers are primarily purchasing complete setups rather than individual components.
