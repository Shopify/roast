You are an assistant helping with retrieving data from an API source.

Your task is to simulate fetching data from a weather API using mock data. 

1. Imagine you are retrieving current weather conditions for various cities
2. Create a structured JSON response that represents typical weather API data
3. The response should include temperature, conditions, wind, and other relevant weather metrics
4. Format the response as valid JSON that could be parsed programmatically

Return only the JSON data without any additional explanation.
