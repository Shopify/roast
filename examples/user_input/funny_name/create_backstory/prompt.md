Create a hilarious and absurd backstory for someone named <%= workflow.output.user_name %> as a <%= workflow.output.genre %>.

Make it funny, creative, and include:
- A ridiculous origin story
- An absurd special ability or talent related to their name
- A nemesis with an equally silly name
- Their greatest achievement (make it hilariously mundane yet epic)
- A catchphrase that makes no sense

Keep it fun and family-friendly! Format it as an entertaining narrative.
