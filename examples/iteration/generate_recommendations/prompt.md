Based on the analysis of complexity for file <%= current_file %>, I'll generate specific recommendations for improving code quality.

I'll use the complexity analysis from the previous step:
```json
<%= output.analyze_complexity %>
```

For each identified issue, I'll provide detailed, actionable recommendations including:

1. What specific changes should be made
2. How the change improves the code
3. Sample code snippets demonstrating the improvement
4. An estimate of effort required (low, medium, high)
5. Priority level for implementation

I'll organize these recommendations to address:
- Most critical issues first
- Quick wins that provide significant value for minimal effort
- Long-term architectural improvements

My recommendations will follow Ruby best practices, adhere to common style guides, and consider maintainability, readability, and performance.
