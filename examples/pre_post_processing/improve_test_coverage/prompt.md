# Improve Test Coverage

Based on the analysis of {{file}}, implement the following improvements:

1. **Add Missing Test Cases**: Write tests for uncovered code paths, edge cases, and error conditions
2. **Improve Test Descriptions**: Make test names more descriptive and follow consistent naming conventions
3. **Enhance Assertions**: Add more specific assertions to catch regressions
4. **Test Data**: Use more realistic test data that better represents production scenarios
5. **Remove Redundancy**: Eliminate duplicate tests or merge similar ones

Generate the improved test code and explain the rationale for each change.

Remember to:
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing test interfaces
- Follow the project's testing conventions and style guide
- Ensure new tests are fast and deterministic
- Add appropriate comments for complex test scenarios
