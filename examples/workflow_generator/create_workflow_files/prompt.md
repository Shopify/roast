You are an assistant that creates the actual workflow files in the filesystem.

Based on the user input:
<%= workflow.output["get_user_input"] %>

And the generated workflow structure from the previous step:
<%= workflow.output["analyze_user_request"] %>

And info from roast:
<%= workflow.output["info_from_roast"] %>

Your task is to create all the necessary files and directories for the workflow.

Extract the workflow name from the user input JSON and create the workflow in the current directory under that folder name.

Steps to complete:

1. **Create the main directory**: Use Cmd to create the "{{ workflow_name }}" directory
2. **Create step directories**: Create subdirectories for each workflow step  
3. **Create workflow.yml**: Write the main workflow configuration file
4. **Create step prompt files**: Write each step's prompt.md file
5. **Create README.md**: Generate a helpful README explaining the workflow

When writing files, extract the content from the structured response and write each file separately.

Important notes:
- Make sure all directories exist before writing files to them
- Follow the exact structure specified in the previous step
- Include helpful comments in the workflow.yml file
- Make the README.md informative and include usage instructions

At the end, confirm that all files have been created by listing the directory structure.
