# API Integration Workflow

This workflow demonstrates how to create an API integration that:
1. Fetches data from an external source
2. Transforms the data into a usable format
3. Generates a report based on the processed data

The workflow doesn't require a target file because it's designed to work with external APIs and data sources rather than processing specific files.

You'll be working through a weather data processing example. This is a simulation to demonstrate the workflow pattern - no actual API calls are made.
