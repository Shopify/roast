# Check Running Processes

Use the bash tool to analyze running processes:

1. List all processes (ps aux or ps -ef)
2. Find the top 5 CPU-consuming processes
3. Find the top 5 memory-consuming processes
4. Check if any specific development services are running (like databases, web servers)
5. Count total number of processes

Note: The exact commands may vary between macOS and Linux. Use appropriate commands for the detected OS.
