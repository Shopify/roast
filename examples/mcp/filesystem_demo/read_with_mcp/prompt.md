If you found any .txt, .md, or .log files in /tmp from the previous step, pick one and read it using the 
FileSystem MCP tool's read_file function. 

The function expects these parameters:
- path: (the full path to the file you want to read)

If no suitable text files were found, just say "No text files found in /tmp to read".
