Upon reviewing the provided test code, I found that there are no instances of stubbing or mocking present in the `calculator_test.rb` file. The tests are straightforward assertions using the `assert_equal` and `assert_raises` methods provided by the Minitest framework, which do not involve any mocking or stubbing of methods.

Since there are no mocks or stubs to verify against the implementation, I will respond with:

All mocks and stubs verified.

After reviewing the provided test file and searching for custom test helpers, I found that there are no custom assertions or helper methods used in the `calculator_test.rb` file. The tests rely solely on the built-in assertions provided by Minitest, such as `assert_equal` and `assert_raises`.

Since there are no custom test helpers to analyze, I will conclude with the following:

All custom test helpers verified.

========== TEST GRADE REPORT ==========
Test file: /fake-testing-dir/simple_project/calculator_test.rb



FINAL GRADE:
  Score: 90/100
  Letter Grade: A 🎉


RUBRIC SCORES:

  Test Helpers Usage (20% of grade):

    Value: 10.0

    Score: 10/10 - "The suite uses no custom helpers at all, so there is no risk of misuse or indirection. Tests stay straightforward and self-contained."

  Mocks and Stubs Usage (20% of grade):

    Value: 10.0

    Score: 10/10 - "No mocking or stubbing is employed; all assertions exercise real behavior through the public interface, keeping the tests reliable and loosely coupled."

  Test Readability (20% of grade):

    Value: 8.0

    Score: 8/10 - "Method names like `test_addition` and `test_division_by_zero` clearly state intent; structure is simple and assertions are easy to scan, though names could be slightly more expressive of scenarios."

  Test Maintainability (20% of grade):

    Value: 9.0

    Score: 9/10 - "Tests target only public methods and observable results, with minimal setup and no coupling to implementation details, so future refactors should rarely break them."

  Test Effectiveness (20% of grade):

    Value: 8.0

    Score: 8/10 - "Positive and negative paths are covered for each operation, including edge cases such as division by zero and invalid factorial/fibonacci inputs; a few extreme numeric edge cases remain untested but overall coverage is solid."





========== TEST RECOMMENDATIONS ==========
Recommendation #1:
Description: Add edge-case tests for each arithmetic method (e.g., very large integers, Float::INFINITY, and mixed integer/float inputs)
Impact: Improves coverage of numerical-limit behavior and floating-point handling, catching overflow/precision bugs
Priority: High

Code Suggestion:

def test_addition_with_large_and_float_values
  assert_equal 1_000_000_005, @calculator.add(1_000_000_000, 5)
  assert_in_delta Float::INFINITY, @calculator.add(Float::INFINITY, 1), 0.0
end

def test_multiplication_with_large_values
  assert_equal 1_000_000_000_000, @calculator.multiply(1_000_000, 1_000_000)
end

Recommendation #2:
Description: Add negative-path tests that validate argument-type handling for all methods (e.g., strings, nil)
Impact: Ensures robust error handling and prevents silent failure when unexpected types are passed
Priority: High

Code Suggestion:

def test_addition_with_invalid_types_raises_type_error
  assert_raises(TypeError) { @calculator.add('1', 2) }
  assert_raises(TypeError) { @calculator.add(nil, 2) }
end

Recommendation #3:
Description: Expand factorial tests to include a moderately large value (e.g., 20) to verify big-integer correctness and performance
Impact: Increases effectiveness by validating factorial beyond trivial inputs
Priority: Medium

Code Suggestion:

def test_factorial_of_20
  assert_equal 2432902008176640000, @calculator.factorial(20)
end

Recommendation #4:
Description: Add boundary tests for power with zero and negative bases
Impact: Covers mathematical edge cases often missed in refactors
Priority: Medium

Code Suggestion:

def test_power_with_zero_and_negative_base
  assert_equal 0, @calculator.power(0, 5)
  assert_equal(-8, @calculator.power(-2, 3))
  assert_equal 4, @calculator.power(-2, 2)
end

Recommendation #5:
Description: Include high-value prime and composite checks to exercise square-root loop limits
Impact: Validates performance and correctness for large inputs
Priority: Medium

Code Suggestion:

def test_is_prime_with_large_numbers
  assert_equal true,  @calculator.is_prime?(7919)  # prime
  assert_equal false, @calculator.is_prime?(7920)  # composite
end

Recommendation #6:
Description: Rename tests to express full behavior context, turning terse names into specifications
Impact: Improves readability and documentation value of the suite
Priority: Low

Code Suggestion:

# Replace
def test_addition
# With
def test_add_returns_correct_sum_for_positive_negative_and_float_inputs

Recommendation #7:
Description: Group similar assertions inside a single logically-named test to reduce duplication (e.g., Fibonacci sequence values) or convert to a loop for maintainability
Impact: Reduces boilerplate, making future additions easier
Priority: Low

Code Suggestion:

def test_fibonacci_sequence_first_ten_values
  expected = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]
  expected.each_with_index do |val, n|
    assert_equal val, @calculator.fibonacci(n)
  end
end
