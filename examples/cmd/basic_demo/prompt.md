# Basic Command Demonstration

You are demonstrating basic command functions. Execute several simple commands to show how the command tool system works.

**SPECIFIC TASKS:**
1. Show the current working directory: use `pwd`
2. List all files with details: use `ls -la`
3. Display celebratory message: use `echo "ðŸŽ‰ Command functions are working!"`
4. List examples directory: use `ls examples/`

**EFFICIENCY RULES:**
- Execute each command ONLY ONCE
- DO NOT repeat any command
- Follow the exact order above

Each command execution demonstrates how commands are called as functions in the workflow, with security enforced through the workflow's configuration.

RESPONSE FORMAT
Provide a summary of your command executions in JSON format:
