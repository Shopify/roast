description: Example combining both continue and context summary features

# This example shows how both parameters can work together for complex workflows

steps:
  # Initial exploration
  - explore_api
  
  # First coding agent task
  - ^implement_client
  
  # Continue with context awareness
  - ^add_error_handling
  
  # Final implementation with full context
  - ^create_integration_tests

add_error_handling:
  continue: true  # Continue working on the same client
  include_context_summary: true  # Include context about what was explored and built

create_integration_tests:
  continue: true  # Continue in the same session
  include_context_summary: true  # Full context of implementation
