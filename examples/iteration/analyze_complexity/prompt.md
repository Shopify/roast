I'll analyze the code complexity of the file <%= current_file %>, which I've read in the previous step.

I'll examine the following aspects:
1. Cyclomatic complexity (number of decision paths)
2. Method length and complexity
3. Class size and responsibilities
4. Code smells (long parameter lists, deeply nested blocks, etc.)
5. Potential performance bottlenecks
6. Opportunities for refactoring

```ruby
<%= output.read_file %>
```

Based on this analysis, I'll provide a structured assessment of the code quality issues found.

For each issue identified, I'll assign:
- Severity (high, medium, low)
- Type (complexity, maintainability, performance, style)
- Location (line numbers, method/class names)
- Brief description of the issue
- Suggested improvement
