name: Swarm Example Workflow

# Example workflow demonstrating Roast's integration with Claude Swarm
# The Swarm tool is available to the LLM, which can choose to use it when appropriate

tools:
  - Roast::Tools::Swarm:
      path: ".swarm.yml"  # Optional - will use default locations if not specified

steps:
  - orchestrate_refactoring: |
      Help me refactor this codebase for better performance. Coordinate multiple 
      Claude agents using the swarm configuration to:
      1. Analyze the current code structure
      2. Identify performance bottlenecks
      3. Implement optimizations
      4. Ensure backward compatibility
      
  - continue_refactoring: |
      Continue the refactoring work from the previous step. Build on the optimizations
      already implemented and focus on:
      - Completing any unfinished optimizations
      - Adding performance benchmarks
      - Documenting the changes made
      
  - specialized_analysis: |
      Now use the specialized swarm configuration at ./specialized-swarm.yml to run 
      a comprehensive code analysis that includes:
      - Architecture review
      - Security audit  
      - Documentation generation
      - Test coverage analysis
      
  - generate_report: |
      Generate a comprehensive report summarizing all the work done in this workflow.
      Include insights from the refactoring and analysis steps.
